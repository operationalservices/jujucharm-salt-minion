  This package is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
  administer servers in a fast and efficient way.  It allows commands to
  be executed across large groups of servers. This means systems can be
  easily managed, but data can also be easily gathered. Quick
  introspection into running systems becomes a reality.  Remote
  execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote
  system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the Salt state system
  uses Salt state files to define the state a server needs to be in.
  Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
  addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.  This
  particular package provides the worker / agent for Salt.
